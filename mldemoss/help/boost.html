<h2>Boosting</h2>
<br>
Boosting is based on the idea of combining weak learners to create a
strong learner (classifier). A weak learner is defined to be a
classifier which is only slightly correlated with the true
classification (it can label examples better than random guessing). In
contrast, a strong learner is a classifier that is arbitrarily
well-correlated with the true classification. More information on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boosting">Wikipedia</a>.<br>
<br>
3 Types of weak learners are implemented here:<br>
<ul>
  <li>Random Projections: project the data onto a random direction, and find the best threshold</li>
  <li>Random Rectangle: selects a random region of space, and returns 1 if the sample is inside the rectangle or 0 otherwise</li>
  <li>Random Circles: selects center points at random, and classifies using the distance to the center (radius)</li>
</ul>
